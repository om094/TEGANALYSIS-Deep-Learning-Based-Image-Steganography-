# TEGANALYSIS-Deep-Learning-Based-Image-Steganography
TEGANALYSIS is a deep learning-driven approach to image steganography that goes beyond traditional methods such as Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation. Instead of concealing small text messages or simple patterns, this project tackles the ambitious challenge of hiding an entire full-size color image within another image .
